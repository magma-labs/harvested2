# Harvested: A Ruby Harvest API

This is a Ruby wrapper for the [Harvest API](http://www.getharvest.com/).

## Installation

    gem install harvested

## Examples

    harvest = Harvest.client('yoursubdomain', 'yourusername', 'yourpassword', :ssl => false) # you can enable SSL if your account supports it
    harvest.projects() # list out projects
    
    client = Harvest::Client.new(:name => "Billable Company LTD.")
    client = harvest.clients.create(client)
    harvest.clients.find(client.id) # returns a Harvest::Client

You can find more examples in `/examples` and in the documentation for Harvest::Base

## Hardy Client

The guys at Harvest built a great API, but there are always dangers in writing code that depends on an API. For example, HTTP Timeouts, Occasional Bad Gateways, and Rate Limiting issues need to be accounted for.

Using `Harvested#client` your code needs to handle all these situations. However you can also use `Harvested#hardy_client` which will retry errors and wait for Rate Limit resets.

    harvest = Harvest.hardy_client('yoursubdomain', 'yourusername', 'yourpassword', :ssl => false)
    harvest.projects() # This will wait for the Rate Limit reset if you have gone over your limit

## How to Contribute

If you find what looks like a bug:

1. Check the GitHub issue tracker to see if anyone else has had the same issue.
http://github.com/zmoazeni/harvested/issues/
2. If you donâ€™t see anything, create an issue with information on how to reproduce it.

If you want to contribute an enhancement or a fix:
 
1. Fork the project on github http://github.com/zmoazeni/harvested
2. Make your changes with tests
3. Commit the changes without messing with the Rakefile, VERSION, or history
4. Send me a pull request

Note on running tests: most cucumber features run against a live Harvest account. To run the suite, sign up for a free trial account and fill out `/features/support/harvest_credentials.yml` *(a sample harvest_credentials.example.yml has been included)*. The tests use the hardy_client so they will wait for a rate limit reset when they detect the limit has been hit.

## TODO

* Write Documentation
* Implement Invoices
* Allow Timer Toggling

Other Roadmap items can be found on [Pivotal Tracker](http://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/63260)

## Notes on Harvest Estimates

Estimates aren't currently supported due to lack of an API. If this opens up, harvested will include them.
